# Zmbackup Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Zmbackup documentation.

Zmbackup is a reliable hot backup software for Zimbra Open Source Email Platform. It can backup accounts, messages, alias, and distribution lists, to easily restore later. The main goal behind this project is develop a software that is easy to use, versatile, and a great substitute to paid solutions.

This documentation covers the Zmbackup 1.2.0 Release Candidate, the first release to come with this material. We have no plans to create one for the releases 1.1.0 and 1.0.0.
